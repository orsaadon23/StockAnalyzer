We want to build a stock recommendation platform.

We'll start with a simple POC, that will include collecting data, analyzing it, and reflecting to the user whether it meets a certain criteria.

Disclaimer: no need to understand the stock market or the specific used pattern, and no fiscal activity should be based on that POC :

 

The system should track a set of stocks (for the POC, we'll start with the magnificent 7 companies - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla). It should sample the values of those tracked stocks and store them to an efficient reliable data store. Samples should be gathered with 5 minutes interval during the trading day.

 

Data should be stored for 3 days, after which it should be discarded.

 

The user is able to query the data through a dedicated API, that checks whether a simple prediction pattern called "cup and handle" matches a given stock data and answers accordingly (a yes/no indication, based on last sample and backwards).

 

The system should support the above functionality and work correctly.

Any further optimizations for performance, cost, scalability, security, user management, etc. are not part of assignment scope - but the implementation should be future-ready as possible to allow accommodating those later.

 

Everything should be running locally, with no usage of cloud assets at all.


For the assignment description above, compare a few different suggestions for an architecture that fits the description. for each option explain the trade-offs. consider implementation complexity, scalability and speed of responses.
